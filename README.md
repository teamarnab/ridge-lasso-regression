# ridge-lasso-regression
Implemented Ridge and Lasso Regression on a given Dataset.

Implemented on Hitters Dataset that predicts salary of a baseball hitter based on various featurs.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. Check the dataset if it needs cleaning.
2. Check the dataset if it needs missing value treatment.
3. Check the dataset if it needs scaling.
4. Split data into training data and testing data.
5. Create a linear regression model to predict profit depending on various independent feature.
6. Check the accuracy of your model.
7. Try applying Ridge and Lasso to improve accuracy.

STEPS FOLLOWED
1. Importing required libraries.
2. Loading dataset.
3. Check first five rows of the dataset.
4. Creating a copy of the dataset.
5. Statistical info about dataset.
6. Getting information on dataset.
7. Checking unique values in State column and encoding them (I have used label encoder).
8. Scaling the Dataset. I have used (standard scaler).
9. Splitting data into training set and testing set.
10. Creating linear regression model.
11. Making predictions using test dataset.
12. Checking the accuracy of the model with test dataset, training dataset and complete dataset.
13. Applying Ridge.
14. Applying Lasso.

CONCLUTION
= The dataset was originally performing bd with multiple linear regression. 
- Accuracy improved a bit with Ridge.
- Accuracy improved a bit with Lasso but Ridge performed better.
- Dataset would be suitable for other regression model, other than linear, ridge and lasso.

THIS WORKSHEET ID FOR RIDGE AND LASSO PRACTICE. SO DIDN'T ADVANCE ANY MORE.
